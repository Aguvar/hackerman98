What the fuck did you+ just fucking say about me,+ you little bitch?+ I’ll have you know+ I graduated top of my class+ in the Navy Seals,+ and I’ve been involved+ in numerous secret raids+ on Al-Quaeda,+ and I have over+ 300 confirmed kills.+ I am trained in gorilla+ warfare and I’m the top+ sniper in the entire+ US armed forces.+ You are nothing to me+ but just another target.+ I will wipe you the+ fuck out with precision+ the likes of which has+ never been seen before+ on this Earth,+ mark my fucking words.+ You think you can get+ away with saying that+ shit to me over+ the Internet?+ Think again, fucker.+ As we speak+ I am contacting my secret network+ of spies across the USA and+ your IP is being traced+ right now so you better+ prepare for the storm,+ maggot.+ The storm that wipes out+ the pathetic little thing+ you call your life.+ You’re fucking dead,+ kid.+ I can be anywhere,+ anytime,+ and I can kill you in over+ seven hundred ways,+ and that’s just+ with my bare hands.+ Not only am I+ extensively trained+ in unarmed combat,+ but I have access to+ the entire arsenal of the+ United States Marine Corps+ and I will use it to its full extent+ to wipe your miserable ass off+ the face of the continent,+ you little shit.+ If only you could have known+ what unholy retribution your little+ “clever” comment was about+ to bring down upon you,+ maybe you would have held+ your fucking tongue.+ But you couldn’t,+ you didn’t,+ and now you’re+ paying the price,+ you goddamn idiot.+ I will shit fury+ all over you and you+ will drown in it.+ You’re fucking dead, kiddo.+

Did you ever hear the tragedy+ of Darth Plagueis The Wise?+ I thought not.+
It’s not a story+ the Jedi would tell you.+ It’s a Sith legend.+ Darth Plagueis was a Dark+ Lord of the Sith,+ so powerful and so wise+ he could use the Force+ to influence the midichlorians+ to create life…+
He had such a knowledge+ of the dark side that+ he could even keep the ones+ he cared about from dying.+ The dark side of the Force+ is a pathway to many abilities+ some consider to be+ unnatural.+ He became so powerful…+ the only thing he+ was afraid of+ was losing his power,+ which eventually,+ of course,+ he did.+
Unfortunately,+ he taught his apprentice+ everything he knew,+ then his apprentice+ killed him in his sleep.+ Ironic.+ He could save others from death,+ but not himself.+

Has it not occurred to you+ that the voice you've+ read my post in is in fact+ the voice in your head?+ It's your voice,+ it bears your tone,+ and your judgement values.+ How about this:+ Why are you being a little bitch?+ I am the matriarch+ of redditarian gang banging, dear.+ Do you not know who I am?+ I am desperately lonely.+ Are you trying to be my friend?+ Because you've got an interesting+ way of going about it.+ I'm ok with this,+ I can work with this,+ this is what we do.+ I do this.+ (That's an ICP reference. Get it?)+ Or am I wrong?+ Are you hurt or offended by something I said?+ Have I wronged you somehow?+ Are you upset?+ Do you feel trolled?+ As your friend,+ I feel obliged to inform you that+ if you said "yes" to any of these questions,+ you might be misattributing+ things to me which do not exist.+ If you don't understand what that means,+ how about don't sit there and+ tell me I'm both somehow subjective+ and also wrong.+ You can't have it both ways.+ So what's it going to be, chummer?+ I am The House.+ And The House says the door is open.+ Are you going to walk in here,+ fuck my shit up,+ and steal my properties?+ Ok, that's rude.+ We could also just chill.+ If I think I'm someone who thinks they're deeper+ than they actually are,+ then clearly I must dig deeper.+ I died once,+ true story.+ Listen... everything I've said in this thread...+ you must read in a voice with a friendly tone.+ And before you interrupted me,+ a youthful jubilence.+ You're abrasive,+ I'm sure you already know that.+ I understand I can be abrasive as well.+ I can understand you,+ I need you to understand me.+ If you don't understand me,+ we can't be friends.+ If we can't be friends, then you best+ get to stepping because you're+ in my way. Are you good?+

Our moon is so useless and pathetic+ compared to all of the cool moons+ out there in the solar system.+ While so much other moons have+ all these cool features,+ all our Moon did was hit us,+ and then get a free ride+ orbiting us for a few billion years.+
Europa is such a cool moon,+ that it could potentially have+ liquid water underneath.+ The gravitational effects+ of its planet Jupiter,+ and some of Jupiter's other Moons+ (including Ganymede,+ a moon so sick,+ it is bigger than the planet Mercury,+ and almost as big as Mars;+ Callisto,+ another huge ass moon bigger than ours,+ one that might even have water as well;+ and Io,+ a pizza coloured moon with+ fucking sulfuric volcanoes)+ cause internal movement for the body,+ meaning there might not only+ be the biggest ocean currently+ known in the universe there,+ but it could very well have geothermic vents.+ Geothermic vents mean that there+ could potentially be life there!+ Our stupid ass moon can't+ do none of that shit, it's just barren.+
How about Titan?+ Easily the biggest moon of Saturn,+ it is so big its gravity+ helps Saturn's smaller moons from+ crashing into the ringed planet+ - it is literally saving their lives!+ Could our moon do that? Nah,+ it's too pathetic to do anything of the sort.+ Not only that,+ but it is the only moon with a proper greenhouse+ effect going on,+ it literally has an atmosphere,+ and oceans made out of liquid methane+ (and some scientists think there might even be water).+ Could our moon have an atmosphere?+ The flimsy little dust bubble+ it has around it hardly counts,+ it's so shit.+
Look at our friend Triton.+ It was a dwarf planet in its own right,+ and not only any dwarf planet,+ but the largest one,+ bigger than Pluto and Eris.+ However,+ the poor thing was brutally captured by Neptune,+ and is now in a orbit around the planet,+ going the opposite way from the other moons to+ show its uniqueness.+ It also has geysers that throw out gaseous+ nitrogen that it carries around in it,+ creating its own atmosphere,+ and making it one of the 4 places in the+ solar system with known geological activity,+ apart from the Earth,+ Io and Saturn's Enceladus+ (that motherfucker is covered in fresh ice and it's+ of the shiniest things in the solar system,+ cos it erupts water vapour).+ Could OUR moon have geological activity?+ Of fucking course not.+
+Even Charon is cooler than the moon,+ and it doesn't even orbit a real planet.+ Its around half the size of Pluto,+ and its so massive,+ it actually makes Pluto wobble around a point+ outside of Pluto itself,+ making it more of a+ duo-planetary system then a moon.+ It affects the environment so much+ scientists say that the other moons,+ rather than orbiting Pluto,+ orbit a Pluto-Charon system.+ Can our tiny-ass moon do that?+ No it can't.+
So anyways, fuck the moon.+

Simply put, no.+ Really, the idea of a world+ without mustard doesn't even make sense.+ Think about it...+ what else would fill the nasally void?+ What else provides such versatile flavor?+ Mustard has always been the most+ beautiful thing on this entire planet.+ Mustard will always be the most tasty+ thing in the universe.+ Sure,+ mustard alone is questionably tasty.+ But mustard doesn't work alone,+ must amplifies other lesser flavors.+ Even those who claim they don't eat mustard+ are just fooling themselves.+ Remember homeopathy?+ Well,+ pretty much everything is homeopathically+ contaminated with mustard,+ and mustard has brought their food greatness.+ Donald Trump thinks he can make America great again.+ No, he alone cannot.+ But mustard can.+ We should not build a wall.+ We should build a goddamn mustard waterfall.+ Niagara Falls?+ How about Mustard Falls?+ This is the only way to+ make mustard great again,+ scientifically proven in exactly+ 0 controlled trials,+ in eπi +1 peer reviewed journals.+ Why would this make America great again?+ Imagine if you could take any boring sandwich+ and slather it in mustard just by putting it outside.+ That's right, we're going to make mustard rain.+ The whole world would be spiced up a notch.+ Bland sandwiches would be edible again.+ Decent sandwiches would be mindblowing.+ Productivity would skyrocket a whopping 10,000%+ with all the newfound enthusiasm for life.+ South Korea and North Korea would be friends again.+ Israelis and Palestinians would stop killing each other.+ Instead, they would all revel in their love of mustard.+ Long story short,+ mustard not only binds this world together,+ but is the solution for all of this world's problems.+
Burn on, my friend.+

My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old.+ My house is in the northeast section of Morioh,+ where all the villas are, and I am not married.+ I work as an employee+ for the Kame Yu department stores,+ and I get home every day+ by 8 PM at the latest.+ I don't smoke,+ but I occasionally drink.+ I'm in bed by 11 PM,+ and make sure I get eight hours of sleep,+ no matter what.+ After having a glass of warm milk+ and doing about twenty minutes of stretches+ before going to bed,+ I usually have no problems sleeping until morning.+ Just like a baby,+ I wake up without any fatigue+ or stress in the morning.+ I was told there were no issues at my last check-up.+ I'm trying to explain that+ I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life.+ I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies,+ like winning and losing,+ that would cause me to+ lose sleep at night.+ That is how I deal with society,+ and I know that is what+ brings me happiness.+ Although, if I were to fight+ I wouldn't lose to anyone.+
